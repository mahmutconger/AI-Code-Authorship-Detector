This provides some\n        assurance that, if accepts() returns True, the convert() method will also be able to handle the document.\n\n        IMPORTANT: In rare cases, (e.g., OutlookMsgConverter) we need to read more from the stream to make a final\n        determination. Read operations inevitably advances the position in file_stream. In these case, the position\n        MUST be reset it MUST be reset before returning. This is because the convert() method may be called immediately\n        after accepts(), and will expect the file_stream to be at the original position.\n\n        E.g.,\n        cur_pos = file_stream.tell() # Save the current position\n        data = file_stream.read(100) # ... peek at the first 100 bytes, etc.\n        file_stream.seek(cur_pos)    # Reset the position to the original position\n\n        Parameters:\n        - file_stream: The file-like object to convert. Must support seek(), tell(), and read() methods.\n        - stream_info: The StreamInfo object containing metadata about the file (mimetype, extension, charset, set)\n        - kwargs: Additional keyword arguments for the converter.\n\n        Returns:\n        - bool: True if the converter can handle the document, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        raise NotImplementedError(\n            f\"The subclass, {type(self).__name__}, must implement the accepts() method to determine if they can handle the document.\"\n        )\n\n    def convert(\n        self,\n        file_stream: BinaryIO,\n        stream_info: StreamInfo,\n        **kwargs: Any,  # Options to pass to the converter\n    ) -> DocumentConverterResult:\n        \"\"\"\n        Convert a document to Markdown text.\n\n        Parameters:\n        - file_stream: The file-like object to convert.

The exception\n        is the PlainTextConverter, HtmlConverter, and ZipConverter, which get\n        priority PRIORITY_SPECIFIC_FILE_FORMAT (== 10), with lower values\n        being tried first (i.e., higher priority).\n\n        Just prior to conversion, the converters are sorted by priority, using\n        a stable sort. This means that converters with the same priority will\n        remain in the same order, with the most recently registered converters\n        appearing first.\n\n        We have tight control over the order of built-in converters, but\n        plugins can register converters in any order. The registration's priority\n        field reasserts some control over the order of converters.\n\n        Plugins can register converters with any priority, to appear before or\n        after the built-ins. For example, a plugin with priority 9 will run\n        before the PlainTextConverter, but after the built-in converters.\n        \"\"\"\n        self._converters.insert(\n            0, ConverterRegistration(converter=converter, priority=priority)\n        )",
